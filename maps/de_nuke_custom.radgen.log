Sorting the data...

The higher number of vertices each mesh has, the longer this will take exponentially...
It is also limited by the 'Max Number Of Vertices Per Mesh Limit' and 'Max Number Of Vertices Per Mesh Face Limit' keyvalues in your radgen_config entity.
You can raise or lower these values, but use with caution. Increasing them may drastically decrease speed, and decreasing them could speed radgen up, but could also cause some mesh faces to no longer be shown.

The default value for 'Max Number Of Vertices Per Mesh Limit' is 2048.
Currently, it is set to 2048.
Meshes with more than 2048 vertices will be skipped.

The default value for 'Max Number Of Vertices Per Mesh Face Limit' is 8.
Currently, it is set to 8.
Mesh faces with more than 8 vertices will be skipped.

This can lead to faces being created that do not exist in the level. Consider splitting the mesh up into multiple meshes to avoid this.
If you can't see an issue in your radar image, you can safely ignore this.
